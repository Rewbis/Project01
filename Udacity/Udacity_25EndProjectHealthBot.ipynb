    "## HealthBot: AI-Powered Patient Education System\n",
    "MediTech Solutions is a leading healthcare technology company that provides software solutions to hospitals and clinics worldwide. They're looking to innovate in the field of patient education and engagement, recognizing that well-informed patients lead to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The Challenge  \n",
    "MediTech Solutions has identified a critical gap in patient education. Many patients struggle to understand their medical conditions, treatment options, and post-treatment care instructions. This lack of understanding can lead to poor adherence to treatment plans, unnecessary hospital readmissions, and overall poorer health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Role  \n",
    "As a Healthcare AI Specialist at MediTech Solutions, you've been tasked with developing a prototype for an AI-powered \"HealthBot\" that can provide personalized, on-demand health information to patients. This chatbot should be able to answer patient queries, provide summarized medical information, and assess patient understanding through simple quizzes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HealthBot Prototype  \n",
    "Your task is to create a LangGraph-based workflow for the HealthBot that includes the following functionality:\n",
    "  \n",
    "Ask the patient what health topic or medical condition they'd like to learn about.\n",
    "Use the Tavily search engine (via LangChain community tool) to find relevant, up-to-date medical information on the topic.\n",
    "Summarize the Tavily search results into a patient-friendly explanation.\n",
    "Present the summarized information to the patient and allow them to read it.\n",
    "Prompt the patient to indicate when they're ready for a comprehension check.\n",
    "Generate a single, relevant quiz question based on the provided information.\n",
    "Present the quiz question to the patient.\n",
    "Allow the patient to enter their answer to the quiz question.\n",
    "Evaluate the patient's response, providing a grade and explanation. The explanation should include relevant citations from the summary to reinforce learning.\n",
    "Present the grade and explanation to the patient.\n",
    "Ask if the patient would like to learn about another health topic or exit the session.\n",
    "Either restart the flow for a new topic or end the session. Ensure that the state is reset when starting a new topic to maintain privacy and accuracy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Goals and Impact  \n",
    "The HealthBot prototype aims to:\n",
    "  \n",
    "Improve patient understanding of medical conditions and treatments.\n",
    "Provide 24/7 access to reliable health information.\n",
    "Reduce the workload on healthcare providers for basic patient education.\n",
    "Improve patient engagement and empowerment in their own healthcare.\n",
    "Potentially reduce hospital readmissions and improve treatment adherence.\n",
    "If successful, this prototype could be expanded into a full-fledged product offering by MediTech Solutions, revolutionizing patient education in healthcare facilities worldwide."

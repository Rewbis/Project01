    "Ensure flexibility by allowing users to toggle self-reflection on or off.\n",
    "Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent should always generate at least one response before self-reflection.\n",
    "If self-reflection is enabled, it should run at least once more to critique and improve its output.\n",
